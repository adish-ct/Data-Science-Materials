STATISTICS
----------


Statistics is the science of Collecting, Organizing and Analyzing.


Two types of Statistics.

	1. Descriptive Statistics (Organizing and summarizing of data)
		(Pdf, Histogram, Box plot, Bar chart, Pie Chart)

		"summarize and organize the characteristics of a data set. 			Whether you’re dealing with a sample or the entire population"

	2. Inferential Statistics (Consist of using that you've measured)
		(Hypothesis Testing, P value, Z test, T test, Anova)

		"Inferential statistics is like the Sherlock Holmes of the data 		world. It takes your sample data (the clues) and deduces truths 		about the entire population (the elusive criminal)."

# We will denote population(N) and sample(n)


SAMPLING TECHNIQUES
--------------------

1. Simple Random Sampling
	"Every member of the population(N) has an equal chance of being selected 	for your sample(n)".
2. Stratified Sampling.
	"Imagine organizing a masquerade ball for data points. You divide the 	population into exclusive groups (strata) based on certain 	characteristics (like species in a zoo: pandas, penguins, unicorns)"
3. Systematic Sampling.
	"Here, we follow a systematic beat. Let’s say you have a list of 	customers. You pick every nth customer (e.g., every 10th customer) from 	the list."
4. Convenience Sampling.
	"The lazy Sunday brunch approach. You grab whatever data points are 	readily available. Maybe you survey your friends or colleagues because 	they’re within arm’s reach."




A. Variable

1. Quantitative Variable : Measured Numerically (Natural number)
	1a. Discreate variable : Whole number (Number of eyes)
	1b. Continues variable : Float values (Height, length)

2. Qualitative Variable(Categorical)  : Measured without Numerical value(Gender, Religion)



B. Variable Measurement Scale.
	b1. Nominal Data(Categorical Data)
	b2. Ordinal Data(Percentile)
	b3. Interval Data.
	b4. Histogram
